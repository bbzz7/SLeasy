         Demonstrates the new CustomBounce ease that'll create a bouncing CustomEase according to the parameters you feed in (like strength and squash)
         and also [optionally] create an accompanying "squash" ease curve that is perfectly synchronized with the bounce so that you can apply
         other complimentary effects that kick in on the bounce (typically squashing/stretching).

         Special properties:

         - strength: a value between 0 and 1 (default: 0.7) that controls the bounciness. The higher the number, the more bouncy.

         - squash: A number that controls how much of a gap is introduced between each bounce to make room for the "squash" to happen. A common value is 2. Default is 0 (no squash)

         - squashName: The name that you want assigned to the squish CustomEase. By default, it will simply append "-squash" to the name you give the bounce.

         In the example, the green line is the bounce, and the brown line is the accompanying squash ease. Play with the strength/squish values and see what happens.

         If you think about the physics of a ball bouncing (one that’s really bouncy/squashy), when it hits the ground it doesn’t INSTANTLY go back up; it strikes, compresses (so it’s still on the ground this whole time), then transfers energy back up and takes off again. That's the "stick" or gap in the bounce. The squash.
